# Literature
This repository is used to store relevant literature.

## Collection
* Each relevant book, paper, proceedings, preprint or similar can be stored here.
* The file should be named by the authors last names, underscore and the full title in camel case.
* It is supposed to be sorted by type and sometimes also further by topic. For each document there is a corresponding entry in `LIST.md`.
* The entries are sorted by authors last name.
* They contain all authors first and last names and the title.
* For entries that are not stored in this repository an additional tag is provided.
* Also if the entry appears in a bib file, the corresponding reference tag is stored.
* Finally, a description can be provided, e.g. containing reasons, interesting information and changes.
* Layout sticks to given format.

## Preprints
* Preprints can also be stored, but have the respective section and are not listed as paper.
* The preprint collection should be checked regularly if the entry got published. Then update the file and sort accordingly.

## .bib-Files
* In order to cite entries from the collection, this repository provides centrally managed `.bib`-files.
* If you update the `.bib`-files please propagate them accordingly.
